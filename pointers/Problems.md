# Question No. 1
Write a C++ program in which you input an array from user and print it using pointer.
# Question No. 2
Write a program that swap two numbers using pointers.
# Question No. 3
Write a program to declare and initialize variables x of type integer and y of type float. Also print the
values and addresses of these variables on the screen using pointer notation.
# Question No. 4
Write a program that will read id numbers and place them in an array. The array is
dynamically allocated large enough to hold the number of id numbers given by the user. The program will then input an id and call a function to search for that id in the array. It will print whether the id is in the array or not.
# Question No. 5
Write a program that will read scores into an array. The size of the array should be input by
the user (dynamic array). The program will find and print out the average of the scores. It
will also call a function that will sort (using a bubble sort or your choice) the scores in
ascending order. The values are then printed in this sorted order.
# Question No. 6
Write a C++ program which creates pointer variables for the data types int, float, char and
double, initializes these pointers with the addresses of variables of respective data types and
prints the size of pointer and the data held by these pointers.
# Question No. 7
Write a C++ program which declares and initializes a 1D â€“ int array with ten elements.
Initialize the elements of array using for loop and display the contents of array using a pointer.
# Question No. 8
Repeat the above task but instead of passing array to function, use pointer as argument to
display the contents of array.
# Question No. 9
Write a C++ program to sort the values of randomly generated array values in descending
order.
# Question No. 10
Write a C++ program to search for key values ( input by user) in a 1D array of 15 elements
using linear search.
# Question No. 11
Repeat the above task using binary search.
